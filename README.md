- Hello, this is mostly a github meant to showcase my skills in bioinformatics, data science, and a variety of other computational fields. I am currently a full-time graduate student in bioinformatics and am in the process of porting more of my projects to GitHub, buyer beware however that this will likely be a slow process due to my general business.
